## User Manual:
Clone this app into your machine. Run script that is responsible for launching (`npm start` in this case). 
Also you need to run backend app, which you can find [here](https://github.com/elisabedashvili-exceed/Notes-App-Backend). Clone this app also 
and run it with `npm run dev`. After that you should register (without confirmation, just one easy step) and login to use app, add, edit, and delete notes.
While adding note you can attach image also. When you attach image, set cropping and rotating options according to your wish you should click 
"Finish editing and attach image" button, you'll get alert message in case of success and only after that you can click big mark icon to save note with image.

You can enjoy the app without deploying into machine from [here](https://notes-app-pern.herokuapp.com/).
